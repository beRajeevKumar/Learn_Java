# Learning Java Programming...

Java is a high-level, class-based, object-oriented programming language designed to have minimal implementation dependencies. I learned Java to understand the fundamentals of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and to solve Data Structures and Algorithms problems. Through this process, I gained a solid foundation in programming principles and OOP concepts, enhancing my problem-solving skills using Java.

## Topics I learned

- Java Basics
- Control Statements
- Arrays
- Strings
- Functions and Parameters
- Object-Oriented Programming
  - Classes and Objects
  - Constructors
  - Access Modifiers
  - `Static`, `this` and `super` Keyword
  - Encapsulation
  - Abstraction
  - Polymorphism
    - Method Overloading
    - Method Overriding
    - Runtime Polymorphism
  - Inheritance
  - Interfaces
  - Abstract Classes
  - Inner Classes
  - Packages
  - Exception Handling
  - Collections
- More...
